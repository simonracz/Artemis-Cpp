Artemis-Cpp
===========

An Entity System framework. (Mostly for games.)

It has a similar API than the [Artemis Entity System](http://gamadu.com/artemis/) java framework.

Please note that the API needs a documentation and also a rewrite. I want to put every public calls into the World class. Be careful, because for example removing an Entity through the World object differs from removing it through the EntityManager object. This needs to be cleared up.

This is a fork from [ArtemisCPP](https://bitbucket.org/stalei/artemiscpp) by Sidar Talei.
